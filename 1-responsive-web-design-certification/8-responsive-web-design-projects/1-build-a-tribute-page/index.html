            <h4 class="font-weight-light text-center">Highlights of the Life and Theories of Sigmund Freud:</h4>
              <ul class="text-left">

                <li>He is known today as an influential thinker in the realms of psychology and medicine.</li>

                <li>In 1856, Freud was born in Moravia, but shortly thereafter his family moved to and resided in Vienna.</li>

                <li>Freud considered himself a scientist before anything else, and studied biology and then neurology at the University of Vienna.</li>

                <li>Freud was initially intrigued with hypnosis, until further experimentation led him to realize that the effects wore off too quickly.</li>

                <li>Freud then came up with the idea that neuroses such as phobias, hysterical paralysis, and paranoia could be eased by talking about the origins of the neuroses, which resulted from deep and traumatic past experiences hidden from consciousness.</li>

                <li>This new treatment for neuroses would allow the patient to confront and deal with their past experiences so that they could move on, a technique described in Freud's book <span class="font-italic">Studies in Hysteria</span>.</li>

                <li>Freud's next book, <span class="font-italic">The Interpretation of Dreams</span>, is known today as his best work.</li>

                <li>In <span class="font-italic">The Interpretation of Dreams</span>, Freud writes of his theory of the unconscious mind, in that dreams are the result of two mental processes: unconscious forces that reveal a wish, and censorship of said wish. </li>

                <li>Freud introduces readers to his controversial theory,  named the "Oedipus complex," stating that in the psychosexual development process of a human, a child has an unconscious desire for the parent of the opposite gender.</li>

                <li>Freud wrote more works such as <span class="font-italic">The Psychopathology of Everyday Life</span>, <span class="font-italic">Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality</span>, <span class="font-italic">Five Lectures on Psycho-Analysis</span>, and <span class="font-italic">The Ego and the Id</span>.</li>

                <li>At first, Freud's theories were not well-received due to the taboo sexual nature of the analyses. Once Freud gave a series of lectures in the United States, his work was taken more seriously.</li>

                <li>Freud wrote many more works before his death, in total more than twenty volumes of theoretical works and clinical studies.</li>

                <li>Sigmund Freud died in 1939 from cancer.</li>
              </ul>
