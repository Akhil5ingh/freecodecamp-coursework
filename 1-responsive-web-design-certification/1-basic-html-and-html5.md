## Say Hello to HTML Elements 
Welcome to Free Code Camp's first coding challenge.

You can edit code in your text editor, which we've embedded into this web page.

Do you see the code in your text editor that says `<h1>Hello</h1>`? That's an HTML element.

Most HTML elements have an opening tag and a closing tag.

Opening tags look like this: `<h1>` Closing tags look like this: `</h1>`

- [x] Your h1 element should have the text "Hello World".

```
<h1>Hello World</h1>
```


## Headline with the h2 Element 
Over the next few challenges, we'll build an HTML5 app that will look something like this:

A screen shot of our finished Cat Photo App

The h2 element you enter will create an h2 element on the website.

This element tells the browser about the structure of your website. h1 elements are often used for main headings, while h2 elements are generally used for subheadings. There are also h3, h4, h5 and h6 elements to indicate different and new sections.

Add an h2 tag that says "CatPhotoApp" to create a second HTML element below your "Hello World" h1 element.

- [x] Create an h2 element.
- [x] Make sure your h2 element has a closing tag.
- [x] Your h2 element should have the text "CatPhotoApp".
- [x] Your h1 element should have the text "Hello World".

```
<h1>Hello World</h1>
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
```


## Inform with the Paragraph Element 
p elements are the preferred element for normal-sized paragraph text on websites. P is short for "paragraph".

You can create a p element like this:

`<p>I'm a p tag!</p>`

Create a p element below your h2 element, and give it the text "Hello Paragraph".

- [x] Create a p element.
- [x] Your p element should have the text "Hello Paragraph".
- [x] Make sure your p element has a closing tag.

```
<h1>Hello World</h1>
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<p>Hello Paragraph</p>
```


## Fill in the Blank with Placeholder Text 
Web developers traditionally use lorem ipsum text as placeholder text. The 'lorem ipsum' text is randomly scraped from a famous passage by Cicero of Ancient Rome.

Lorem ipsum text has been used as placeholder text by typesetters since the 16th century, and this tradition continues on the web.

Well, 5 centuries is long enough. Since we're building a CatPhotoApp, let's use something called kitty ipsum text.

Replace the text inside your p element with the first few words of this kitty ipsum text: Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.

- [x] Your p element should contain the first few words of the provided kitty ipsum text.

```
<h1>Hello World</h1>
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
```


## Uncomment HTML

Commenting is a way that you can leave comments for other developers within your code without affecting the resulting output that is displayed the end user.

Commenting is also a convenient way to make code inactive without having to delete it entirely.

Comments in HTML starts with `<!--`, and ends with a `-->`


Uncomment your h1, h2 and p elements.

- [x] Make your h1 element visible on your page by uncommenting it.
- [x] Make your h2 element visible on your page by uncommenting it.
- [x] Make your p element visible on your page by uncommenting it.
- [x] Be sure to delete all trailing comment tags, i.e. `-->`.

```
<h1>Hello World</h1>
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
```


## Comment out HTML 
Remember that in order to start a comment, you need to use `<!--`  and to end a comment, you need to use `-->`

Here you'll need to end the comment before your h2 element begins.

Remember that in order to start a comment, you need to use `<!--` and to end a comment, you need to use `-->`

Here you'll need to end the comment before your h2 element begins.


Comment out your h1 element and your p element, but not your h2 element.

- [x] Comment out your h1 element so that it is not visible on your page.
- [x] Leave your h2 element uncommented so that it is visible on your page.
- [x] Comment out your p element so that it is not visible on your page.
- [x] Be sure to close each of your comments with `-->`.
- [x] Do not change the order of the h1 h2 or p in the code.

```
<!--
<h1>Hello World</h1>
-->
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<!--
<p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
-->
```


## Delete HTML Elements 
Our phone doesn't have much vertical space.

Let's remove the unnecessary elements so we can start building our CatPhotoApp.

Delete your h1 element so we can simplify our view.

- [x] Delete your h1 element.
- [x] Leave your h2 element on the page.
- [x] Leave your p element on the page.

```
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
```


## Introduction to HTML5 Elements

HTML5 introduces more descriptive HTML tags. These include header, footer, nav, video, article, section and others.

These tags make your HTML easier to read, and also help with Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and accessibility.

The main HTML5 tag helps search engines and other developers find the main content of your page.

Note
Many of the new HTML5 tags and their benefits are covered in the Applied Accessibility section.


Create a second p element after the existing p element with the following kitty ipsum text: `Purr jump eat the grass rip the couch scratched sunbathe, shed everywhere rip the couch sleep in the sink fluffy fur catnip scratched`.

Wrap the paragraphs with an opening and closing main tag.

- [x] You need 2 p elements with `Kitty Ipsum text`.
- [x] Make sure each of your p elements has a closing tag.
- [x] Your p element should contain the first few words of the provided additional `kitty ipsum text`.
- [x] Your code should have one main element.
- [x] The main element should have two paragraph elements as children.
- [x] The opening main tag should come before the first paragraph tag.
- [x] The closing main tag should come after the second closing paragraph tag.

```
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>
    <p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
    <p>Purr jump eat the grass rip the couch scratched sunbathe, shed everywhere rip the couch sleep in the sink fluffy fur catnip scratched.</p>
</main>
```



## Add Images to your Website 
You can add images to your website by using the img element, and point to a specific image's URL using the `src` attribute.

An example of this would be:

`<img src="https://www.your-image-source.com/your-image.jpg">`

All img elements must have an `alt` attribute. The text inside an `alt` attribute is used for screen readers to improve accessibility and is displayed if the image fails to load.

Lets add an `alt` attribute to our img example above:

`<img src="https://www.your-image-source.com/your-image.jpg" alt="Author standing on a beach with two thumbs up. ">`

Note that in most cases, img elements are self-closing.

Try it with this image: `https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat`

- [x] Your page should have an image element.
- [x] Your image should have a `src` attribute that points to the kitten image.
- [x] Your image element must have an `alt` attribute.

```

```


## Link to External Pages with Anchor Elements 
a elements, also known as anchor elements, are used to link to content outside of the current page.

Here's a diagram of an a element. In this case, the a element is used in the middle of a paragraph element, which means the link will appear in the middle of a sentence.

Here's an example:

`<p>Here's a <a href="http://freecodecamp.org"> link to Free Code Camp</a> for you to follow.</p>`

Create an a element that links to `http://freecatphotoapp.com` and has "cat photos" as its anchor text.

- [x] Your a element should have the anchor text of "cat photos".
- [x] You need an a element that links to `http://freecatphotoapp.com`
- [x] Make sure your a element has a closing tag.

```
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }

    font-family: Lobster, Monospace;
  }

    font-family: Monospace;
  }
  .thick-green-border {
    border-color: green;
    border-width: 10px;
    border-style: solid;
    border-radius: 50%;
  }
  .smaller-image {
    width: 100px;
  }
</style>
<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>
<img class="smaller-image thick-green-border" src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back. ">
<p><a href="http://freecatphotoapp.com"> cat photos </a></p>
<p class="red-text">Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
<p class="red-text">Purr jump eat the grass rip the couch scratched sunbathe, shed everywhere rip the couch sleep in the sink fluffy fur catnip scratched.</p>
```


## Link to Internal Sections of a Page with Anchor Elements

Anchor elements can also be used to create internal links to jump to different sections within a webpage.

To create an internal link, you assign a link's `href` attribute to a hash symbol `#` plus the value of the `id` attribute for the element that you want to internally link to, usually further down the page. You then need to add the same `id` attribute to the element you are linking to. An id is an attribute that uniquely describes an element.

Below is an example of an internal anchor link and its target element:
```
<a href="#contacts-header">Contacts</a>
...
<h2 id="contacts-header">Contacts</h2>
```
When users click the Contacts link, they'll be taken to the section of the webpage with the Contacts header element.

Change your external link to an internal link by changing the `href` attribute to `"#footer"` and the text from `"cat photos"` to `"Jump to Bottom"`.

Remove the `target="_blank`" attribute from the anchor tag since this causes the linked document to open in a new window tab.

Then add an `id` attribute with a value of `"footer"` to the `<footer>` element at the bottom of the page.

- [x] There should be only one anchor tag on your page.
- [x] There should be only one footer tag on your page.
- [x] The a tag should have an `href` attribute set to `"#footer"`.
- [x] The a tag should not have a target attribute
- [x] The a text should be "Jump to Bottom".
- [x] The footer tag should have an `id` attribute set to `"footer"`.

```
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>
  <a href="#footer">Jump to Bottom</a>
  <img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back.">
  <p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff. Purr jump eat the grass rip the couch scratched sunbathe, shed everywhere rip the couch sleep in the sink fluffy fur catnip scratched. Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>

  <p>Intently stare at the same spot poop in the plant pot but kitten is playing with dead mouse. Get video posted to internet for chasing red dot leave fur on owners clothes meow to be let out and mesmerizing birds leave fur on owners clothes or favor packaging over toy so purr for no reason. Meow to be let out play time intently sniff hand run outside as soon as door open yet destroy couch.</p>
</main>
<footer id="footer">Copyright Cat Photo App</footer>
```


## Nest an Anchor Element within a Paragraph 
Again, here's a diagram of an a element for your reference:

a diagram of how anchor tags are composed with the same text as on the following line

Here's an example:

`<p>Here's a <a href="https://freecodecamp.org"> link to Free Code Camp</a> for you to follow.</p>`

Nesting just means putting one element inside of another element.

Now nest your existing a element within a new p element (just after the existing h2 element) so that the surrounding paragraph says "View more cat photos", but where only "cat photos" is a link, and the rest of the text is plain text.
 
- [x] You need an a element that links to `"http://www.freecatphotoapp.com"`.
- [x] Your a element should have the anchor text of "cat photos"
- [x] Create a new p element around your a element.
- [x] Your a element should be nested within your new p element.
- [x] Your p element should have the text "View more " (with a space after it).
- [x] Your a element should not have the text "View more".
- [x] Make sure each of your p elements has a closing tag.
- [x] Make sure each of your a elements has a closing tag.

```


## Make Dead Links using the Hash Symbol 
Sometimes you want to add a elements to your website before you know where they will link.

This is also handy when you're changing the behavior of a link using jQuery, which we'll learn about later.

Replace the value of your a element's `href` attribute with a #, also known as a hash symbol, to turn it into a dead link.

- [x] Your a element should be a dead link with a href attribute set to "#".

```
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }
  h2 {
    font-family: Lobster, Monospace;
  }
  p {
    font-size: 16px;
    font-family: Monospace;
  }
  .thick-green-border {
    border-color: green;
    border-width: 10px;
    border-style: solid;
    border-radius: 50%;
  }
  .smaller-image {
    width: 100px;
  }
</style>
<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>
<p>Click here for <a href="#">cat photos</a>.</p>
<img class="smaller-image thick-green-border" src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back. ">
<p class="red-text">Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
<p class="red-text">Purr jump eat the grass rip the couch scratched sunbathe, shed everywhere rip the couch sleep in the sink fluffy fur catnip scratched.</p>
```


## Turn an Image into a Link 
You can make elements into links by nesting them within an a element.

Nest your image within an a element. Here's an example:

`<a href="#"><img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-running-cats" alt="Three kittens running towards the camera. "></a>`

Remember to use # as your a element's href property in order to turn it into a dead link.

Place the existing image element within an anchor element.

Once you've done this, hover over your image with your cursor. Your cursor's normal pointer should become the link clicking pointer. The photo is now a link.

- [x] Nest the existing img element within an a element.
- [x] Your a element should be a dead link with a href attribute set to #.
- [x] Make sure each of your a elements has a closing tag.

```
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">

  }
</style>
<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>
  <p>Click here for 
    <a href="#">cat photos</a>.
  </p>
    <a href="#">
      <img class="smaller-image thick-green-border" src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back.">
    </a>
  <p class="red-text">Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff. 
  </p>
  <p class="red-text">Purr jump eat the grass rip the couch scratched sunbathe, shed everywhere rip the couch sleep in the sink fluffy fur catnip scratched.
  </p>
```


## Create a Bulleted Unordered List 
HTML has a special element for creating unordered lists, or bullet point-style lists.

Unordered lists start with a `<ul>` element. Then they contain some number of `<li>` elements.

For example:
```
<ul>
  <li>milk</li>
  <li>cheese</li>
</ul>
```
would create a bullet point-style list of "milk" and "cheese".

Remove the last two p elements and create an unordered list of three things that cats love at the bottom of the page.

- [x] Create a ul element.
- [x] You should have three li elements within your ul element.
- [x] Make sure your ul element has a closing tag.
- [x] Make sure your li elements have closing tags.

```
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }
  h2 {
    font-family: Lobster, Monospace;
  }
  p {
    font-size: 16px;
    font-family: Monospace;
  }
  .thick-green-border {
    border-color: green;
    border-width: 10px;
    border-style: solid;
    border-radius: 50%;
  }
  .smaller-image {
    width: 100px;
  }
</style>
<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>
<p>Click here for <a href="#">cat photos</a>.</p>
<a href="#"><img class="smaller-image thick-green-border" src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back. "></a>
<ul>
  <li>milk</li>
  <li>toys</li>
  <li>hairballs</li>
</ul>
```


## Create an Ordered List 
HTML has a special element for creating ordered lists, or numbered-style lists.

Ordered lists start with a `<ol>` element. Then they contain some number of `<li>` elements.

For example:
```
<ol>
  <li>Garfield</li>
  <li>Sylvester</li>
</ol>
```
would create a numbered list of "Garfield" and "Sylvester".

Create an ordered list of the top 3 things cats hate the most.

- [x] You should have an ordered list for "Top 3 things cats hate:"
- [x] You should have an unordered list for "Things cats love:"
- [x] You should have three li elements within your ul element.
- [x] You should have three li elements within your ol element.
- [x] Make sure your ul element has a closing tag.
- [x] Make sure your ol element has a closing tag.
- [x] Make sure your li element has a closing tag.

```

```


## Create a Text Field 
Now let's create a web form.

Text inputs are a convenient way to get input from your user.

You can create one like this: `<input type="text">`

Note that input elements are self-closing.

Create an input element of type text below your lists.

- [x] Your app should have an input element of type text.

```
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }
  h2 {
    font-family: Lobster, Monospace;
  }
  p {
    font-size: 16px;
    font-family: Monospace;
  }
  .thick-green-border {
    border-color: green;
    border-width: 10px;
    border-style: solid;
    border-radius: 50%;
  }
  .smaller-image {
    width: 100px;
  }
</style>
<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>
<p>Click here for <a href="#">cat photos</a>.</p>
<a href="#"><img class="smaller-image thick-green-border" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back. " src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat"></a>
<p>Things cats love:</p>
<ul>
  <li>cat nip</li>
  <li>laser pointers</li>
  <li>lasagna</li>
</ul>
<p>Top 3 things cats hate:</p>
<ol>
  <li>flea treatment</li>
  <li>thunder</li>
  <li>other cats</li>
</ol>
<input type="text">
```


## Add Placeholder Text to a Text Field 
Your placeholder text is what appears in your text input before your user has input anything.

You can create placeholder text like so:

`<input type="text" placeholder="this is placeholder text">`

Set the placeholder value of your text input to "cat photo URL".

- [x] Add a placeholder attribute text input element.
- [x] Set the value of your placeholder attribute to "cat photo URL".
- [x] The finished input element should have valid syntax.

```
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }
  h2 {
    font-family: Lobster, Monospace;
  }
  p {
    font-size: 16px;
    font-family: Monospace;
  }
  .thick-green-border {
    border-color: green;
    border-width: 10px;
    border-style: solid;
    border-radius: 50%;
  }
  .smaller-image {
    width: 100px;
  }
</style>
<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>
<p>Click here for <a href="#">cat photos</a>.</p>
<a href="#"><img class="smaller-image thick-green-border" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back. " src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat"></a>
<p>Things cats love:</p>
<ul>
  <li>cat nip</li>
  <li>laser pointers</li>
  <li>lasagna</li>
</ul>
<p>Top 3 things cats hate:</p>
<ol>
  <li>flea treatment</li>
  <li>thunder</li>
  <li>other cats</li>
</ol>
<input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL">
```

## Create a Form Element 
You can build web forms that actually submit data to a server using nothing more than pure HTML. You can do this by specifying an `action` on your form element.

For example:

`<form action="/url-where-you-want-to-submit-form-data"></form>`

Nest your text field in a form element. Add the `action="/submit-cat-photo"` attribute to this form element.

- [x] Nest your text input element within a form element.
- [x] Make sure your form has an `action` attribute which is set to `/submit-cat-photo`
- [x] Make sure your form element has a closing tag.

```

## Add a Submit Button to a Form 
Let's add a submit button to your form. Clicking this button will send the data from your form to the URL you specified with your form's `action` attribute.

Here's an example submit button:

`<button type="submit">this button submits the form</button>`

Add a submit button to your form element with `type submit` and "Submit" as its text.

- [x] Your form should have a button inside it.
- [x] Your submit button should have the attribute `type` set to `submit`.
- [x] Your submit button should only have the text "Submit".
- [x] Make sure your button element has a closing tag.

## Use HTML5 to Require a Field 
You can require specific form fields so that your user will not be able to submit your form until he or she has filled them out.

For example, if you wanted to make a text input field required, you can just add the word required within your input element, you would use: `<input type="text" required>`

Make your text input a required field, so that your user can't submit the form without completing this field.

Then try to submit the form without inputing any text. See how your HTML5 form notifies you that the field is required?

Note: This field does not work in Safari.

- [x] Your text input element should have the `required` attribute.

## Create a Set of Radio Buttons 
You can use radio buttons for questions where you want the user to only give you one answer.

Radio buttons are a `type` of input

Each of your radio buttons should be nested within its own label element.

All related radio buttons should have the same `name` attribute.

Here's an example of a radio button:

`<label><input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor"> Indoor</label>`

Add a pair of radio buttons to your form. One should have the option of indoor and the other should have the option of outdoor.

- [x] Your page should have two radio button elements.
- [x] Give your radio buttons the `name` attribute of `indoor-outdoor`.
- [x] Each of your two radio button elements should be nested in its own label element.
- [x] Make sure each of your label elements has a closing tag.
- [x] One of your radio buttons should have the `label indoor`.
- [x] One of your radio buttons should have the `label outdoor`.

## Create a Set of Checkboxes 
Forms commonly use checkboxes for questions that may have more than one answer.

Checkboxes are a `type` of input

Each of your checkboxes should be nested within its own label element.

All related checkbox inputs should have the same `name` attribute.

Here's an example of a checkbox:

`<label><input type="checkbox" name="personality"> Loving</label>`

Add to your form a set of three checkboxes. Each checkbox should be nested within its own label element. All three should share the name attribute of personality.

- [x] Your page should have three checkbox elements.
- [x] Each of your three checkbox elements should be nested in its own label element.
- [x] Make sure each of your label elements has a closing tag.
- [x] Give your checkboxes the name attribute of personality.

## Check Radio Buttons and Checkboxes by Default 
You can set a checkbox or radio button to be checked by default using the `checked` attribute.

To do this, just add the word `"checked"` to the inside of an input element. For example:

`<input type="radio" name="test-name" checked>`

Set the first of your radio buttons and the first of your checkboxes to both be checked by default.

- [x] Your first radio button on your form should be checked by default.
- [x] Your first checkbox on your form should be checked by default.

## Nest Many Elements within a Single Div Element 
The div element, also known as a division element, is a general purpose container for other elements.

The div element is probably the most commonly used HTML element of all. It's useful for passing the CSS of its own class declarations down to all the elements that it contains.

Just like any other non-self-closing element, you can open a div element with `<div>` and close it on another line with `</div>`.

Try putting your opening div tag above your "Things cats love" p element and your closing div tag after your closing ol tag so that both of your lists are within one div.

Nest your "Things cats love" and "Things cats hate" lists all within a single div element.

- [x] Nest your p elements inside your div element.
- [x] Nest your ul element inside your div element.
- [x] Nest your ol element inside your div element.
- [x] Make sure your div element has a closing tag.

## Declare the Doctype of an HTML Document

The challenges so far have covered specific HTML tags and their uses. However, there are a few elements that give overall structure to your page, and should be included in every HTML document.

At the top of your document, you need to tell the browser which version of HTML your page is using. HTML is an evolving language, and is updated regularly. Most major browsers support the latest specification, which is HTML5. However, older web pages may use previous versions of the language.

You tell the browser this information by adding the `<!DOCTYPE ...>` tag on the first line, where the `"..."` part is the version of HTML. For HTML5, you use `<!DOCTYPE html>`.

The `!` and uppercase `DOCTYPE` is important, especially for older browsers. The html is not case sensitive.

Next, the rest of your HTML code needs to be wrapped in html tags. The opening `<html>` goes directly below the `<!DOCTYPE html>` line, and the closing `</html>` goes at the end of the page.

Here's an example of the page structure:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<!-- Your HTML code goes here -->
</html>
```
Add a `DOCTYPE` tag for HTML5 to the top of the blank HTML document in the code editor. Under it, add opening and closing html tags, which wrap around an h1 element. The heading can include any text.

- [x] Your code should include a `<!DOCTYPE html>` tag.
- [x] There should be one html element.
- [x] The html tags should wrap around one h1 element.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<h1> This is my HTML heading</h1>
</html>
```


## Define the Head and Body of an HTML Document

You can add another level of organization in your HTML document within the html tags with the head and body elements. Any markup with information about your page would go into the head tag. Then any markup with the content of the page (what displays for a user) would go into the body tag.

Metadata elements, such as `link`, `meta`, `title`, and `style`, typically go inside the head element.

Here's an example of a page's layout:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<!-- metadata elements -->
</head>
<body>
<!-- page contents -->
</body>
</html>
```
Edit the markup so there's a head and a body. The head element should only include the title, and the body element should only include the h1 and p.

- [x] There should be only one head element on the page.
- [x] There should be only one body element on the page.
- [x] The head element should be a child of the html element.
- [x] The body element should be a child of the html element.
- [x] The head element should wrap around the title element.
- [x] The body element should wrap around both the h1 and p elements.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>The best page ever</title>
    </head>
    <body>
    <h1>The best page ever</h1>
        <p>Cat ipsum dolor sit amet, jump launch to pounce upon little yarn mouse, bare fangs at toy run hide in litter box until treats are fed. Go into a room to decide you didn't want to be in there anyway.
