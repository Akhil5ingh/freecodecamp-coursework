## Declare JavaScript Objects as Variables 
Before we dive into Object Oriented Programming, let's revisit JavaScript objects.

Give your motorBike object a wheels, engines and seats attribute and set them to numbers.

- [x] `motorBike` should have a engines attribute set to a number.
- [x] `motorBike` should have a wheels attribute set to a number.
- [x] `motorBike` should have a seats attribute set to a number.

```
var car = {
  "wheels":4,
  "engines":1,
  "seats":5
};
var motorBike = {
  "wheels" : 2,
  "engines" : 6,
  "seats" : 9
  // Only change code below this line.
};
```


## Construct JavaScript Objects with Functions 
We are also able to create objects using constructor functions.

A constructor function is given a capitalized name to make it clear that it is a constructor.

Here's an example of a constructor function:
```
var Car = function() {
  this.wheels = 4;
  this.engines = 1;
  this.seats = 5;
};
```
In a constructor the this variable refers to the new object being created by the constructor. So when we write,

  `this.wheels = 4;`

inside of the constructor we are giving the new object it creates a property called `wheels` with a value of `4`.

You can think of a constructor as a description for the object it will create.

Have your `MotorBike` constructor describe an object with `wheels`, `engines` and `seats` properties and set them to numbers.

- [x] `MotorBike` should have a `engines` attribute set to a number.
- [x] `MotorBike` should have a `wheels` attribute set to a number.
- [x] `MotorBike` should have a `seats` attribute set to a number.

```
var Car = function() {
  this.wheels = 4;
  this.engines = 1;
  this.seats = 5;
};
// Only change code below this line.
var MotorBike = function() {
  this.wheels = 2;
  this.engines = 6;
  this.seats = 9;
};
```


## Make Instances of Objects with a Constructor Function 
Now let's put that great constructor function we made in the last lesson to use!

To use a constructor function we call it with the new keyword in front of it like:

`var myCar = new Car();`

`myCar` is now an instance of the Car constructor that looks like the object it described:
```
{
  wheels: 4,
  engines: 1,
  seats: 5
}
```
Note that it is important to use the new keyword when calling a constructor. This is how Javascript knows to create a new object and that all the references to this inside the constructor should be referring to this new object.

Now, once the `myCar` instance is created it can be used like any other object and can have its properties accessed and modified the same way you would usually. For example:

`myCar.turboType = "twin";`

Our `myCar` variable now has a property `turboType` with a value of `"twin"`.

In the editor, use the `Car` constructor to create a new instance and assign it to `myCar`.

Then give `myCar` a `nickname` property with a string value.

- [x] The property `wheels` should still be 4 in the object constructor.
- [x] There should not be a property `nickname` in the object constructor.
- [x] The property `wheels` of `myCar` should equal `4`.
- [x] The property `nickname` of `myCar` should be a string.

```
var Car = function() {
  this.wheels = 4;
  this.engines = 1;
  this.seats = 5;
};
// Only change code below this line.
var myCar = new Car();
myCar.nickname = "chip";
```


## Make Unique Objects by Passing Parameters to our Constructor 
The constructor we have is great, but what if we don't always want to create the same object?

To solve this we can add parameters to our constructor. We do this like the following example:
```
var Car = function(wheels, seats, engines) {
  this.wheels = wheels;
  this.seats = seats;
  this.engines = engines;
};
```
Now we can pass in arguments when we call our constructor.

var myCar = new Car(6, 3, 1);

This code will create an object that uses the arguments we passed in and looks like:
```
{
  wheels: 6,
  seats: 3,
  engines: 1
}
```
Now give it a try yourself! Alter the `Car` constructor to use parameters to assign values to the `wheels`, `seats`, and `engines` properties.

Then call your new constructor with three number arguments and assign it to `myCar` to see it in action.

- [x] Calling `new Car(3,1,2)` should produce an object with a wheels property of 3, a `seats` property of `1`, and an `engines` property of `2`.
- [x] Calling `new Car(4,4,2)` should produce an object with a wheels property of 4, a `seats` property of `4`, and - [x] an `engines` property of `2`.
Calling `new Car(2,6,3)` should produce an object with a wheels property of 2, a `seats` property of `6`, and an `engines` property of `3`.
- [x] `myCar` should have number values for the `wheels`, `seats`, and `engines` properties.

```
var Car = function(wheels, seats, engines) {
  //Change this constructor
  this.wheels = wheels;
  this.seats = seats;
  this.engines = engines;
};
//Try it out here
var myCar = new Car(2, 6, 9);
```


## Make Object Properties Private 
Objects have their own attributes, called properties, and their own functions, called methods.

In the previous challenges, we used the `this` keyword to reference public properties of the current object.

We can also create private properties and private methods, which aren't accessible from outside the object.

To do this, we create the variable inside the constructor using the var keyword we're familiar with, instead of creating it as a property of `this`.

This is useful for when we need to store information about an object but we want to control how it is used by outside code.

For example, what if we want to store the speed our car is traveling at but we only want outside code to be able to modify it by accelerating or decelerating, so the speed changes in a controlled way?

In the editor you can see an example of a `Car` constructor that implements this pattern.

Now try it yourself! Modify the `Bike` constructor to have a private property called `gear` and two public methods called `getGear` and `setGear` to get and set that value.

Further explanation on `this` keyword

- [x] The method `getGear` of myBike should be accessible outside the object.
- [x] The method `setGear` of myBike should be accessible outside the object.
- [x] `myBike.gear` should remain undefined.
- [x] `myBike.getGear()` should return `4` after calling `myBike.setGear(4)`.
- [x] `myBike.getGear()` should return `3` after calling `myBike.setGear(3)`.
- [x] `myBike.getGear()` should return `1` after calling `myBike.setGear(1)`.

```
var Car = function() {
  // this is a private variable
  var speed = 10;
  // these are public methods
  this.accelerate = function(change) {
    speed += change;
  };
  this.decelerate = function() {
    speed -= 5;
  };
  this.getSpeed = function() {
    return speed;
  };
};
var Bike = function() {
  // Only change code below this line.
var gear = 1;
  this.getGear = function () {
    return gear;
  };
  this. setGear = function (no) {
    gear = no;
    return gear;
  };
};
var myCar = new Car();
var myBike = new Bike();
```


## Iterate over Arrays with map 
The `map` method is a convenient way to iterate through arrays. Here's an example usage:
```
var oldArray = [1, 2, 3];
var timesFour = oldArray.map(function(val){
  return val * 4;
});
console.log(timesFour); // returns [4, 8, 12]
console.log(oldArray);  // returns [1, 2, 3]
```
The `map` method will iterate through every element of the array, creating a new array with values that have been modified by the callback function, and return it. Note that it does not modify the original array.

In our example the callback only uses the value of the array element (the val argument) but your callback can also include arguments for the index and array being acted on.

Use the `map` function to add 3 to every value in the variable `oldArray`, and save the results into variable `newArray`. `oldArray` should not change.

- [x] You should not change the original array.
- [x] You should add three to each value in the array.
- [x] You should be making use of the `map` method.
- [x] You should only modify the array with `map`.

```
var oldArray = [1,2,3,4,5];
// Only change code below this line.
var newArray = oldArray.map(function(val){
  return val + 3;
});
```


## Condense arrays with reduce 
The array method `reduce` is used to iterate through an array and condense it into one value.

To use `reduce` you pass in a callback whose arguments are an accumulator (in this case, `previousVal`) and the current value (`currentVal`).

The accumulator is like a total that reduce keeps track of after each operation. The current value is just the next element in the array you're iterating through.

`reduce` has an optional second argument which can be used to set the initial value of the accumulator. If no initial value is specified it will be the first array element and `currentVal` will start with the second array element.

Here is an example of `reduce` being used to subtract all the values of an array:
```
var singleVal = array.reduce(function(previousVal, currentVal) {
  return previousVal - currentVal;
}, 0);
```
Use the `reduce` method to sum all the values in array and assign it to `singleVal`.

`singleVal` should be equal to the sum of all items in the array variable.
You should have made use of the `reduce` method.

```
var array = [4,5,6,7,8];
var singleVal = 0;
// Only change code below this line.
singleVal = array.reduce(function(thisVal, nextVal) {
  return thisVal + nextVal;
}, 0);
```


## Filter Arrays with filter 
The `filter` method is used to iterate through an array and filter out elements where a given condition is not true.

`filter` is passed a callback function which takes the current value (we've called that val) as an argument.

Any array element for which the callback returns true will be kept and elements that return false will be filtered out.

The following code is an example of using `filter` to remove array elements that are equal to five:

Note: We omit the second and third arguments since we only need the value
```
array = array.filter(function(val) {
  return val !== 5;
});
```
Use `filter` to create a new array with all the values from `oldArray` which are less than 6. The `oldArray` should not change.

- [x] You should not change the original array.
- [x] You should have filtered out all values from the array that are greater than 5.
- [x] You should be using the `filter` method to create a new array.
- [x] You should only be using `filter` to make the new array.

```
var oldArray = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10];
// Only change code below this line.
var newArray = oldArray.filter(function(val) {
  return val < 6;
});
```


## Sort Arrays with sort 
You can use the method `sort` to easily sort the values in an array alphabetically or numerically.

Unlike the previous array methods we have been looking at, `sort` actually alters the array in place. However, it also returns this sorted array.

`sort` can be passed a compare function as a callback. The compare function should return a negative number if a should be before b, a positive number if a should be after b, or 0 if they are equal.

If no compare (callback) function is passed in, it will convert the values to strings and sort alphabetically.

Here is an example of using `sort` with a compare function that will sort the elements from smallest to largest number:

var array = [1, 12, 21, 2];
array.sort(function(a, b) {
  return a - b;
});

Use `sort` to sort array from largest to smallest.

Further explanation on the `.sort()` method can be found here.

- [x] You should have sorted the array from largest to smallest.
- [x] You should only be using `sort` to modify the array.
- [x] You should have made use of the sort method.

```
var array = [1, 12, 21, 2];
// Only change code below this line.
array.sort(function(a, b) {
  return b - a;
});
```


## Reverse Arrays with reverse 
You can use the `reverse` method to reverse the elements of an array.

`reverse` is another array method that alters the array in place, but it also returns the reversed array.

var myArray = [1, 2, 3];
myArray.reverse();
returns [3, 2, 1]

Use `reverse` to reverse the `array` variable and assign it to `newArray`.

- [x] You should reverse the array.
- [x] You should use the `reverse` method.
- [x] You should only be using reverse to modify array.

```
var array = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7];
var newArray = [];
// Only change code below this line.
newArray = array.reverse();
```


## Concatenate Arrays with concat 
`concat` can be used to merge the contents of two arrays into one.

`concat` takes an array as an argument and returns a new array with the elements of this array concatenated onto the end.

Here is an example of `concat` being used to concatenate `otherArray` onto the end of `oldArray`:

`newArray = oldArray.concat(otherArray);`

Use `.concat()` to concatenate concatMe onto the end of `oldArray` and assign it to `newArray`.

- [x] You should concatenate the two arrays together.
- [x] You should be using the `concat` method to merge the two arrays.
- [x] You should only be using `concat` to modify the arrays.

```
var oldArray = [1,2,3];
var newArray = [];
var concatMe = [4,5,6];
// Only change code below this line.
newArray = oldArray.concat(concatMe);
```


## Split Strings with split 
You can use the `split` method to split a string into an array.

`split` uses the argument you pass in as a delimiter to determine which points the string should be split at.

Here is an example of `split` being used to split a string at every `s` character:

`var array = string.split('s');`

Use `split` to create an array of words from string and assign it to array.

- [x] You should use the `split` method on the string.
- [x] You should split the string by its spaces.

```
var string = "Split me into an array";
var array = [];
// Only change code below this line.
array = string.split(' ');
```


## Join Strings with join 
We can use the `join` method to join each element of an array into a string separated by whatever delimiter you provide as an argument.

The following is an example of using `join` to join all of the elements of an array into a string with all the elements separated by word and:
```
var veggies = ["Celery", "Radish", "Carrot", "Potato"];
var salad = veggies.join(" and ");
console.log(salad); // "Celery and Radish and Carrot and Potato"
```
Use the `join` method to create a string from `joinMe` with spaces in between each element and assign it to `joinedString`.

You should join the elements of the array with spaces.
You should use of the `join` method on the array.

```
var joinMe = ["Split","me","into","an","array"];
var joinedString = '';
// Only change code below this line.
joinedString = joinMe.join(" ");
```
