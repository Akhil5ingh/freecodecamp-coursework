# Coursework for FreeCodeCamp
This is my first GitHub repository, featuring my progress, work, and solutions for the FreeCodeCamp online course.

Feel free to get in touch with me regarding this project.
I started FreeCodeCamp in 2017, before the most recent beta release (June 2018). Since the new platform was released I will go back and complete any new challenges that are added until I finish the course.

I have done my best to review and update the challenges so that the code displayed here is in-sync with the updated FreeCodeCamp platform. However, I currently don't have the time to retroactively rewrite every lesson as the wordings are updated quite frequently. I have decided to leave the lesson wording as it was at the time I completed the challenge. Hope this doesn't cause too much confusion, as this is intended to be moreso a documentation of my progress rather than a completely up-to-date version of the FreeCodeCamp lessons and challenges with solutions. Thanks for understanding!
