# Coursework for FreeCodeCamp
This is my first GitHub repository, featuring my progress, work, and solutions for the FreeCodeCamp online course.
Feel free to get in touch with me regarding this project.
I started FreeCodeCamp in 2017, before the most recent beta release (June 2018). Since the new platform was released I have gone back and completed any new challenges that were added. I have done my best to review and update the challenges so that the code displayed here is in-sync with the updated FreeCodeCamp platform. If you see challenges that are different to those displayed here, let me know and I will update my code.
